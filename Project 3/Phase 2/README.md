# ENPM661 : Project3 - Phase 2
## Introduction
* In this project a 300x400 grid is provided where there are four obstacles present. A rigid robot is given a random start and goal position by the user, and it is required to find its path to the goal location.
* A* search method is used in this project for searching the goal location which takes into consideration the cost to come as well as cost to go. The exploration is shown by visualization using half planes method and also the final optimal path is represented through visualization.
## Files
* There are three files in the folder. One is the A* python code, one is the video recording and one is the README file. The files are as follows:
* A_star.py
* Video
* README.md
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* sys
* datetime
* math
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Open the A_star.py file in Pycharm.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* User will be required to enter the x and y co-ordinate of the start as well as the goal location, radius and clearance of robot as well as the theta and step size of the movement.
* A visualization graph as well as optimal path will be shown if valid start and goal location co-ordinates are provided. And a video file will be saved in the folder.
