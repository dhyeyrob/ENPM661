# ENPM 661: Project 3 - Phase 1
## Introduction
* In this project a 300x400 grid is provided where there are four obstacles present. A rigid robot is given a random start and goal position by the user, and it is required to find its path to the goal location such that it avoids collision with the obstacles as well as maintain the required clearance.
* Dijkstra algorithm is used in this project which takes into consideration the cost to come for searching the goal location and the exploration is shown by visualization using half planes method. Moreover, the final optimal path is also represented through visualization.
## Files
* There are three files in the folder. One is the Dijkstra python code, one is the video recording and one is the README file. The files are as follows:
* Dijkstra.py
* Video
* README.md
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* sys
* datetime
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Open the Dijkstra.py file in Pycharm.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* User will be required to enter the x and y co-ordinates of the start as well as the goal location, radius and the clearance of the robot.
* A visualization graph as well as optimal path will be shown if valid start and goal location co-ordinates are provided.
